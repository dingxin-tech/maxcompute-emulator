# MaxCompute Emulator

## Introduction

MaxCompute Emulator is a lightweight utility designed to simulate the behavior of Alibaba Cloud's MaxCompute (previously known as ODPS) service. It leverages SQLite to offer a mock environment for clients who donâ€™t have access to an actual MaxCompute account to test their functionalities. This project is particularly useful for development and testing purposes where MaxCompute resource accessibility or cost constraints are a concern.
